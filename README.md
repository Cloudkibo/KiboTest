# KiboTest
The purpose of this repository is to host the test code for KiboEngage.
We are using following technologies to test the KiboEngage webapp:
- Mocha
- ChaiJS
- NightmareJS (for end to end testing)

This code contains two major files:
- example.js
- test.js

example.js has the code for user interaction simulation.
test.js contains the code for headless testing.
